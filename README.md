Qiita-Sync is a GitHub Actions that can synchronize your markdown files in GitHub repository with Qiita articles.

See more details [Qiita-Sync Command Usage](https://github.com/ryokat3/qiita-sync/blob/main/doc/command_usage.md) for command usage.

# Installation

## Qiita Access Token

1. Generate your access token

   1. Open [Qiita Account Applications](https://qiita.com/settings/applications)
   2. Click "Generate new token"
   3. Copy the access token displayed.

2. Save the access token to GitHub

   1. Open your GitHub repository
   2. Go "Settings" >> "Secrets"
   3. Click "New repository secrets"
   4. Save the access token with the name `QIITA_ACCESS_TOKEN`

## GitHub Actions

1. Download 2 YAML files of GitHub Actions

   - [qiita_sync.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryokat3/qiita-sync/main/github_actions/qiita_sync.yml)
   - [qiita_sync_check.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryokat3/qiita-sync/main/github_actions/qiita_sync_check.yml)

2. Save them in your repository as:

   - `.github/workflow/qiita_sync.yml`
   - `.github/workflow/qiita_sync_check.yml`

   **NOTE**: Change the cron time `cron: "29 17 * * *"` of `qiita_sync_check.yml` which is the time
             when this action is sheduled to be executed. `29 17 * * *` indicates that this action is
             executed every day at 17:29 UTC, which is kind of inactive time for me who is living in Japan.
             Please adjust it to your convenience.

3. Push them to GitHub

## Badge

You can add the link to badge in your README file to show if Qiita and GitHub are successfully synchronized or not.
Please replaece `<Your-ID>` and `<Your-Respository>` of your own.

```markdown
![Qiita Sync](https://github.com/<Your-ID>/<Your-Repository>/actions/workflows/qiita_sync_check.yml/badge.svg)
```

Then the badge will be displayed in your README file.

- synchronized badge:

# Synchronization

When you notice the failure of synchronization by the badge in README or e-mail notification from GitHub,
you can manually run Qiita-Sync GitHub Actions to synchronize them again.

1. Open your GitHub repository
2. Go "Actions" >> "Qiita Sync" (in left pane)
3. Click "Run workflow" (in right pane)

# Writing Articles

Please note some features of Qiita-Sync when writing articles.

## File Name

When downloading Qiita article files at first, their file names are like `2020-07-08_TypeScript_d3c8f2234ea428e4563a.md` whose
naming convention is "\<Created-Date\>\_\<Tag\>\_\<Qiita-Article-ID\>.md". For your convenience,
you can rename those files as you like and can move them to any subdirectories within your git repository directory.

## Article Header

Each downloaded article file has a header. This header is automatically generated when downloaded from Qiita site.
And it is automatically removed when uploaded to Qiita site.

You can cange `title` and `tags` as you like. However **you must not remove `id`** from the header.
It's a key information for synchronization with Qiita site.

And this `id` must be unique. Only one file can included it in the header.
Please not to create article files that have same `id`, which can happen when copying an article file.

```markdown
<!--
title: This header is automatically generated by Qiita-Sync when downloading Qiita articles
tags:  Qiita-Sync
id:    a5b5328c93bad615c5b2
-->
```

When creating new article file, you don't need `id` in the header.

```markdown
<!--
title: No id is necessary in the header when writing new articles
tags:  Qiita-Sync
-->
```

The `id` will be automatically added to the header after uploaded to Qiita site.

## Links to Qiita article

You can use a relative file path as a link to another your article file.

```markdown
<!-- An example of link to another Qiita article when writing -->
[My Article](../my-article.md)
```

This link will be automatically changed to the URL when uploaded to Qiita site.

```markdown
<!-- An example of link to another Qiita article when published to Qiita site -->
[My Article](https://qiita.com/ryokat3/items/a5b5328c93bad615c5b2)
```

And it will be automatically changed to the relative file path when downloaded from Qiita site.

## Links to image file

You can use a relative file path as a link to an image file.

```markdown
<!-- An example of link to image file 'earth.png' when writing-->
![My Image](../image/earth.png)
```

This link will be automatically changed to the URL when uploaded to Qiita site.

```markdown
<!-- An example of link to image file 'earth.png' when published to Qiita site -->
![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryokat3/qiita-articles/main/image/earth.png)
```

And it will be automatically changed to the relative file path when downloaded from Qiita site.
