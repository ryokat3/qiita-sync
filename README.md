# Writing Articles

Please note some features of qiita-sync when writing articles.

## Article Header

Each downloaded articles has a header. This header is automatically generated when downloaded from Qiita site.
And, it is automatically removed when uploaded to Qiita site.

You can cange `title` and `tags` as you like. However **you must not remove `id`**.
It's a key information for synchronization with Qiita site.

```markdown
<!--
title: This header is automatically generated by qiita-sync when downloading Qiita articles
tags:  qiita-sync
id:    a5b5328c93bad615c5b2
-->
```

But, you don't need `id` in the header when you create new articles.

```markdown
<!--
title: No id is necessary in the header when writing new articles
tags:  qiita-sync
-->
```

The `id` will be automatically added to the header after uploaded to Qiita site.

## Links to Qiita article

You can write a link to another your Qiita article as a relative file path like below.

```markdown
<!-- An example of link to another Qiita article when writing -->
[My Article](../my-article.md)
```

This link will be automatically changed to the URL when uploaded to Qiita site.

```markdown
<!-- An example of link to another Qiita article when published to Qiita site -->
[My Article](https://qiita.com/ryokat3/items/a5b5328c93bad615c5b2)
```

And, it will be automatically changed to the relative file path when downloaded from Qiita site.

## Links to image file

You can write a link to an image file as a relative file path like below.

```markdown
<!-- An example of link to image file 'earth.png' when writing-->
![My Image](../image/earth.png)
```

This link will be automatically changed to the URL when uploaded to Qiita site.

```markdown
<!-- An example of link to image file 'earth.png' when published to Qiita site -->
![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryokat3/qiita-articles/main/image/earth.png)
